Both of the two meet-ups offer me a great opportunity to learn new knowledge and meet people in an inspiring and efficient way. I was very excited that many of my questions can be solved very quickly in the meeting. When I tried to figure out the solutions to some questions on my own, it took a lot of time to search online, read instructions, and filter information. Sometimes I got stuck for hours on a single question. However, during the meeting, my questions were all solved quickly and I was inspired by opinions from other people's perspectives. 

Another thing I benefit from these meetings is that it allowed me to meet many people. It was nice talking to people who share similar interest with me and exchanging experience and opinions with each other. 

Overall, it was a great experience to participate the meet-ups and made myself exposed to a broader variety of perspectives.
